# VandGross Construction Co. — Budget Control Dashboard

Basically, my takeaway on the first feature from the video that was i am to build a feature that keeps track of spending within a team, to avoid waste of funds and also inputs expenditures automatically. So i created a mock company, VandGross Construction Co., then firstly, i needed data so i went and gave mock allocated budgets for four departments(project management, engineering, procurement & health and safety), i gave the amount of $10k, $50k, $200k and $5k respectively, then i requested a research for how the allocated budgets would most likely be spent in a construction company and i got results. I used and refined the results for my data in which was inputed to this project.

## Architecture Decisions

- **No UI libraries** — every component built from scratch
- **Design tokens** — all hex values live exclusively in globals.css as CSS custom properties; components never reference raw hex
- **Caching** — TanStack Query with 5-minute stale time; zero redundant requests on revisit
- **Animations** — scroll-triggered via useInView, reduced-motion respected throughout
- **Modern CSS** — clamp(), color-mix(), CSS nesting, container queries, logical properties, :has()
